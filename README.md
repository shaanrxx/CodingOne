Contains my coursework for my game and the tasks throughout the term


For my project I wanted to create a Maze Game that would have a a new maze every time it ran.
I wanted a timer and I wanted it to also have a point system depending on who won.
I found the maze generating section quite difficult as it required a lot of thinking and problem solving.
To make the game as fair as possible I changed my design and had the players strating on opposite sides and have to get to the other players starting position which I found the most effective out of the choice I made. 
I tried to make the players start in the middle but I didn't like how that looked visually.
I also found the countdown area challenging as the numbers would write ontop of each other and instead created a shape for the number to print over making it clearer.
So the game didnt't start straight away, I created a simple splash page to allow the players to get ready before the game starts.
Players have 40 seconds to complete the maze.
If one player completes the game then a pop up announcing the winner will show and the game then restarts on its own.
The maze will automatically generate but if r is pressed at any point the game will then restart.
I like that idea as players could play for as long as they wanted.
A point is added to the players overall score.
If the timer runs out, a game over pop up is shown and there is an option to press restart. No points are added.


Parts of my code, specifically the maze generator sections are sourced from other code online, but integreated into my design to fit my desired outcome.
